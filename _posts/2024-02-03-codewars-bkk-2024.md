### What do I need to bring to Codewar?

We recommend you bring a laptop along to take part. If you don't bring a laptop you can still join another team, or just cheer on the teams as a spectator.
Bring photo ID to get past security downstairs and ask for SevenPeaks.

### What if I don't have a laptop?

You don’t need a laptop to compete if you have a friend with a laptop and they qualify then you can join their team. or write code on a tablet or phone? but each team will need one laptop.
There are often those who qualify without a team so you maybe be able to join their team if you use the
same language.

### Can I bring a friend?

Sure. Just get them to RSVP so we know numbers attending.


### I'm not from thailand, can I still attend?

yes.

You can use any programming language! Popular languages include Python, Ruby, Javascript, Go and C#.
You can change which language you use. Or just come to watch.

### Do I need to code to attend?

No. But you will get a lot more out of it if you do.

### What should I do to prepare to compete?

- know how to open files and read them
- know how to read JSON

### Will there be food and drink?
There will be snacks like pizza, soft drinks and beer available for free thanks to our sponsors. We will have an offical snack break at 16:15pm. 

### Can I create my team before the event?
It's great if you can come with a team, but you will still need to compete in the qualification round. If at least of one of your team solves the qualification round fastest, they can invite others to join their team of 4 people for the knockout round.

### Can I come alone without a team?
Yes! If you are one of the winners of the qualification round we'll help you find more people to join your team so you have 4 total. 

### Can I leave early?

You can leave early if you want… unless you qualify and make it through all the rounds. It’s an elimination tournament of 8 teams. So lots won’t qualify and even fewer will be at the end. The tournament should be around 3 hours.
