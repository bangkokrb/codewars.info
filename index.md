Next Code Wars will be in Bangkok on Saturday 3rd February 2024, with 150-200 developers joining for an afternoon of fun coding challenges!

[Bangkok Code Wars 2024](2024-02-03-codewars-bkk-2024/){: .btn .btn-primary .btn-lg .btn-block role=button}
[RSVP](2024-02-03-codewars-bkk-2024/) and [FAQ](2024-02-03-codewars-bkk-2024/)

## Rules of Code Wars {#rules}   
1. War is Fun!
   - winning doesn't make you a code ninja
   - winning won't improve your hackerrank (or even your [codewars.com rank](https://www.codewars.com/)... this is not us)
   - winning won't double your salary
   - these are silly problems, solved under distracting circumstances. Think "FizzBuzz Fight" not Project Euler.
2. Qualification round - everyone can try
   - A [simple coding question](/test1) will be shown on the big screen.
   - The first 6 individuals to submit the answer become team leaders and get to pick their team of 3 other team mates
   - 2 "wildcard" entrants will come from smug teams (correct answers from the audience) during the tournament
3. Spectate as 8 teams compete in instant knockout tournament of 7 rounds
   - Free beer and pizza. Enjoy the show d d
   - 2 Teams of 4. First team to code the right answer and annouce it wins the round
   - one laptop per team - projected in a large font
   - If no winner within 15 min a clue will be given
   - Last team standing wins
4. Bring your laptop (if you have one)
   - You will think this is not for you
   - Then you will see the problems and want to solve them
   - Then you will regret not bringing your laptop!
   - don't have one? help a friend who has one or just watch
5. You can use **any language** you want
   - even Excel!
   - you do have to write code
   - you can't use AI assistants like Github Copilot
   - English is not a requirement

Still confused? watch [Live stream of Code Wars 2020](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=1016001628885678) to get the idea.

## What are the questions like?

They are fizzbuzz type fun questions that take 5-15min to answer.
They are questions any developer can answer in any language but
it's more fun when you are racing against someone else to get the answer first.

Try for yourself.

### 2018 PyCon Thailand

![2018 pycon Code Wars]({{ "/assets/images/2018_pycon.jpg" | resize: "x300" }})

In 2018, Dylan Jay created a [Code Wars as a warm up event to the first PyCon Thailand](https://2019.th.pycon.org/pycon2018/code-war/index.html). Any language was allowed but python seemed to win anyway.

Memorable because last minute the quizzmaster had somehow lost the answers to the questions so instead the organisers were solving them barely ahead of the contestants. It also seems we relaxed the 3 person per team rule.

### 2016-12-29 - Holiday Edition Social Hack Night on NYEEE (Bangkok)

![2016 BKKHack Code Wars]({{ "/assets/images/2016_bkkhackcodewar.jpg" | resize: "x300" }})

In 2014 Dylan Jay moved to Bangkok and started the first Python Meetup (ThaiPy), the BKK Hack Night and also introduced the
Code Wars concept at the [end of 2016 as a social event for the BKK Hack Night](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/bkkhack/events/cxdkxlyvqbmc/).

Memorable by getting kicked out of the venue at midnight and having to run the final at the regular meetup the following month. Teams were only 2 due to limited space and turnout.

### 2010-2019 Kiwi PyCon (NZ)

From 2010 Kiwi PyCon also included the code war as a warm up event and continued to do so every year. 
In [2014 they messed with the format](https://wellington.pm.org/articles/codewars2014/) so all teams did all [questions](https://github.com/eliotb/codewars2014) and no one got to see anyone's code or sat on the stage being distracted. They didn't do this again.

### 2010-2013 PyConAU (Australia)

![2010 full room]({{ "/assets/images/2010-fullroom.jpg" | resize: "x300" }})

Dylan Jay and Andy Stewart fell in love with the Code Wars concept and when the first ever PyConAU happened in sydney
2010 they proposed it as [a friday night warmup event](http://anyvite.com/byq1czpyyc) before the conference start on the saturday. It was hosted at Atlassian.

It was after this event the rule of the answer having to be both "said" and "on screen". The ambiguous result was resolved
peacefully via a danceoff

#### 2012-2013 PyConAU (Hobart)

![pyconau-2012]({{ "/assets/images/2012-pyconau.webp" | resize: "x300" }})

There is a [good write up of the events in Aug 2012](https://www.curiousvenn.com/2012/08/codewars-at-pycon-au-2012/?fbclid=IwAR0g1Dc2G6aO7UQTRaiND_WWXHfLNsQWQmNJcHx4sImnTiLmp8hGaWKVuNA). Rules were the same except they dropped the one device per team rule. Not sure why.

In 2013 the PyCon Hobart organizers felt the need change the rules to make it a long cryptic adventure that everyone played from the audience which ended up removing all drama, pace and fun out of the event. PyConAu dropped Code Wars after this.


### 2008-2011 WebDU (Sydney, Australia)

![robin hillard]({{ "/assets/images/Robin-Hilliard-Code-Wars-MC.webp" | resize: "x300" }})
![2020 Trophy]({{ "/assets/images/code-wars-trophy-2010.webp" | resize: "x300" }})

Code Wars was created by [Rocketboots CTO Robin Hilliard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinhilliard/) as a warm up social event for friday night before the [WebDU conference](https://www.flickr.com/photos/webdu/3553047315/) in Sydney from 2008. Originally based on an idea from the book [PeopleWare](https://progress4success.com/peopleware-by-tom-demarco-timothy-lister-how-to-successfully-lead-in-the-software-industry-leadership-book-review-part-i/2/) where they did Code Wars experiments on coders and 
found that spaces that are quiter, more private and better protected from interuption let codes complete simple tasks for quickly and with less errors. 
So Code Wars, the event, was born to make good intentioned coders compete in the least quiet, least private and most interuptable environment possible.

Original rules were the roughly the same except
- There was no qualification round. You just signed up
- Semi finals were [40min "creative" rounds judged on audience applause](https://www.eriontheinterweb.com/2010/05/codewars-2010-the-challenge-make-an-app-to-make-steve-jobs-relax-in-flash)... it was a flash/coldfusion conference after all (Any language was still allowed of course...)
